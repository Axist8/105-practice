                <h4>Build good habits</h4>
                <p>Whatever it takes, make sure you have a reliable way of tackling the basic aspects of your reality. As coders, there is a tendency to have a mentality focused on complexity and machine-like thinking.</p>

                <p>Remember!</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Eat well</li>
                  <li>Drink plenty of water</li>
                  <li>Get enough sleep</li>
                  <li>Exercise</li>
                  <li>Stretch</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Your physical being is the basis for how you interact with your life. Treat it with the respect that deserves.</p>

                <p>An app that helped me get a solid routine down is <a href="https://habitica.com">Habitica</a>. If you like games and might need some structure to life this is the right tool.</p>

                <h4>There is an opportunity in every misfortune</h4>
                <p>Life can roll over on you like a torrent of waves in the midst of a mega-storm. Sometimes we can feel desperate and fatally flawed. It's easy to think we're special and uniquely victimized by life's menacing woes.</p>
                <p class="nope">We're not.</p>
                <p>We're all tested in a myriad of ways.. but we can all learn from our mistakes and we all have the capacity for growth. Keep faith in yourself and keep moving forward. If you don't know which way is forward then take time to think. There is a way through every hardhsip and a tool for every job.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="final">You are qualified to dominate your life!</p>
